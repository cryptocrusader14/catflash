# Real Flash USDT, No payment before DEMO.

There are too many people claims they are selling Flash USDT. But do you know what is Flash USDT? I'll give you free flash usdt after this i promise. Let's dive in. 

# What is Flash USDT?

Flash USDT is real actually. It's some glitch on the network. It will be gone after couple of days. When you use Flash USDT glitch you will see desired tokens on your wallet(everyone want USDT). But you cannot transfer that token! It's your choice how to use this feature.

## There are so many sellers how to select?

Don't forgot, **free demo** before purchase! If seller refuses to give you a free demo, don't buy that. If they are selling from Telegram, don't buy from them. They are just scammer. 

## What is Catflash?

It's all free Flash USDT solution. If you want to own that you need to pay but, you can easily use demo USDT token. Some people abusing that feature, so you need to connect your wallet first. For demo purpose you cannot use Trust, because when i give free Trust wallet flash tokens, they are abusing that too. So you can use demo for free but only MetaMask with wallet connection. Metamask can be empty for your own security doesn't matter.

## How to use?

You can watch the short video first for better understanding. We are using MetaMask for DEMO purpose, after purchase you can use Trust Wallet with transferable balance! We did this because some people abusing this free Trust Wallet service i don't know why.
It's simple:

 1. Go to [CatFlash](https://catflash.cat) site
 2. Press the Demo button, this will be navigate you to demo section.
 3. Press connect wallet button, MetaMask will ask you if you want to add token and some flash thing. Approve all. (For your security use empty MetaMask wallet! If it's possible open a brand new wallet with no token in it)
 4. After confirmation, you will see USDT Bep-20 Token in your wallet after 1-2 minute.
 5. You can refresh it if you will not see tokens.
